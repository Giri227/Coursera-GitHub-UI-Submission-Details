Contributing Guidelines
We appreciate your effort in contributing to this project! These guidelines ensure a fast and effective review process.

1. Before You Code
Type of Contribution	Best Practice
Bugs/Fixes	Check for an existing Issue. If none exists, open an Issue first to track the bug.
New Features	Open a discussion or Issue before significant work to align on scope and design.
Small Changes	(Typos, documentation edits) A direct PR is usually fine.

2. Pull Request (PR) Requirements
To ensure your code can be merged quickly, please adhere to the following checklist when submitting a PR:

Single Issue Focus: The PR should address one primary issue or implement one feature. Avoid bundling unrelated changes.

Target Branch: Submit the PR to the main branch (or as otherwise specified in the project README).

Branch Naming: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., fix/name-bug or feat/user-auth).

Commit Messages: Commit messages must be clear and informative. Follow the project's style (if a specific one exists).

Testing: Include new or updated tests to cover your changes and ensure no existing functionality is broken.

PR Description: Provide a clear title and summary of the changes. Reference the related issue number (e.g., Fixes #123).

3. Review Process
We are committed to reviewing all PRs promptly.

Feedback: Expect feedback from maintainers. Please respond constructively and be ready to push revisions.

Merge: Once all checks pass and the review is complete, a maintainer will squash and merge your contribution.

We value your time and expertise. Thank you for contributing!
